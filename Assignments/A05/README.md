## App Idea: After Hours
##### Breif Description: For my app idea, I want to build an app that tells you which restaurants/fast food places are open within a certain mile radius from you.

## Needs:
* Needs to be able to retrieve the users location.
* Needs to be able to find open restaurants based on the users location and current times. I think this would require me to write an api that grabs opening/closing times by google searching restaurants.

## Want:
* I want to be give a ETA to all restaurants in the user custom mile radius.
* I want to be able to tell the user if you can get the food via delivery/doordash/uber eats/etc.

## Wishes:
* I wish to be able to design the app similary to the way snapmap works on the app Snapchat. Where it displays your location (say as a dot) on a movable/scrollable map and you can see which restaurants are within your decided radius (open restaurants would be a green dot, and closed restaurants would be a red dot).
* I wish to be able to search for a food and display which restaurants have it. I think this would require me to access the restaurants menu unless its clearly stated in the name, (ex. User searches "taco" and Taco Bell comes up).
 If I were to search for chicken alfredo, it would be quite harder to justify which restaurants have which item. Maybe I can have an api that goes and finds public menus posted on restaurants websites and ctrl-f (search) for specific items.
